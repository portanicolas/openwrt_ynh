***Be aware that this app for now only configure a reverse proxy to access your OpenWRT installation.***

  Yunohost App to add OpenWRT (a firmware for routeur)

**Status** : The app can be used, it's working. But will not automaticly install OpenWRT, you must have a functionnal OpenWRT before (on the Yunhost server or other server)

It's creating a reverse proxy configuration. Find information on Yunohost wiki for installation/configuration of OpenWRT to work behind a Reverse Proxy

**Of course no plan to install OpenWRT in future**

**IMPORTANT : I have been able to use OpenWRT only on a root URL for a domain, using it in a location is not working with nginx. If you have success in it, please share the rules and I will update this app**
